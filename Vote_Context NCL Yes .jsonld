    "comment": "This NCL proposal came from an open community discussion. I am concerned that the entire culture growing up around Cardano is one of extreme financial tightness. Its like community members are scoring points for being the most negative about any suggested spending on investment or marketing. At the same time some wail on X about our technology being the best, but they have such a paranoid fear of powerful actors taking their upside, that they can't trust any community organisation to actually do sensible fraud free investments to spread the message that we all have about Cardano. This toxic online environment makes no one want to put their name to any spending that might not fully deliver. This creates a timidity in investment. Out go the innovative and the original, as the only thing that gets passed is low-risk, bland, beige. \nThe decentralised entrepreneurial spirit gets extinguished. "
